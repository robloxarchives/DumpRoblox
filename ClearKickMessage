Misc Release clientsided unkick

Actually pretty useful when you need to dump a game or look at dex while you're banned.

Although I'm pretty sure i only needed the game:GetService("GuiService"):ClearError() part for that.

Still pretty cool script tho

game.Players.LocalPlayer:Kick()

game:GetService("GuiService"):ClearError()

wait(1)

local oldchr = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character

game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Archivable = true

local cl = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character:Clone()
