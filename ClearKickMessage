Found this on v3rmillion.rip by searching by keyword "remove kick error"

Actually pretty useful when you need to dump a game or look at dex while you're banned.

Another method is:

game:GetService("GuiService"):ClearError()


]]

game.Players.LocalPlayer:Kick()

game:GetService("GuiService"):ClearError()

wait(1)

local oldchr = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character

game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Archivable = true

local cl = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character:Clone()
